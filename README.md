Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks prove invaluable in oceanic time series study. RNNs capture temporal dependencies, enabling precise modeling of dynamic oceanic phenomena. LSTMs enhance this capability, effectively handling long-term dependencies, crucial for understanding intricate patterns and predicting evolving conditions in marine environments.
